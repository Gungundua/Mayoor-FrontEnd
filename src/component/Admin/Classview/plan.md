# Plan to Address ClassView and Students Component Issues

## Objectives
1. Validate the API token used for fetching data in the ClassView component.
2. Ensure that the filters in the Students and ClassView components are synchronized.
3. Verify that the data fetched from the API is correctly processed and displayed in the chart.

## Steps
1. **API Token Validation**
   - Replace the hardcoded `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid token.
   - Ensure that the token is stored securely and retrieved correctly.

2. **Filter Synchronization**
   - Review the filter options in both components to ensure they match.
   - Implement a shared state or context for managing filter selections across both components.

3. **Data Verification**
   - Add console logs to check the data received from the API.
   - Ensure that the data structure matches the expected format for chart rendering.
   - Handle any errors gracefully and provide user feedback if data cannot be fetched.

4. **Testing**
   - Test the components after making changes to ensure that the filters work as expected and the chart displays the correct data.
   - Verify that the user experience is smooth and intuitive.

5. **Documentation**
   - Document any changes made to the codebase for future reference.
